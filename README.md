This is the source code and data for our paper, *Energy-Efficient Compressive Sensing Accelerator Based on Memristors with Hardware-Software Co-Optimization for Edge Computing (Accepted by National Science Review)*.

### 1.code

#### 1.1 AMP algorithm
The source code of the approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm comes from the formulas in the paper *Donoho DL, Maleki A, Montanari A. Message passing algorithms for compressed sensing: I. Motivation and construction*. 

#### 1.2 MMM & SE strategies
These two strategies are used to optimize the measurement matrix $\Phi$ and the sparse transform matrix $\Psi$ in the AMP algorithm, respectively.


### 2.data

#### 2.1 1D signal
The 1D signal in Fig. 3c is a randomly generated signal with length 64, which is sparse in the DCT domain.


#### 2.2 2D images


### 3.classification

#### 3.1 pretrained_models

#### 3.2 ImageNet_20_classes
